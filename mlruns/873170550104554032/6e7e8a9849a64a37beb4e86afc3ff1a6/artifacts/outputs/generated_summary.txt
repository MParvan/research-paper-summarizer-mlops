 additive models @xcite provide an important family of models for semiparametric regression or classification. Some reasons for the success of additive models are their increased flexibility when compared to linear or generalized linear models and their increased interpretability. Good estimators in additive models in general less prone to the curse of high dimensionality than good estimator in fully nonparametric models.
